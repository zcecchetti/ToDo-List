# Todo-List

This project is to create a working Todo-list application that can be accessed through a person's
browser. The end product will have the ability to save data to the local drive, so when a person
reloads the page, the content should remain the same.

Within the page, there will be a button to create new lists and each list should populate as a new
tab on the page. The user should be able to click through different tabs. Additionally, each list 
should have the option to create a new task to complete (new todo). The tasks should be able to be 
edited, should be able to be rearranged, and optionally should be able to be color coded by the user 
to reflect urgency.
